TECHNOLOGICAL DISPARITY

A major update which adds new buildings and mechanics, plus a new playable faction.

Highlights:
- Some factions now start with techs already researched, but suffer from a research penalty at the start of the game

- New faction: Deadrock Clan
The Deadrock Clan is a forward thinking, family-run business, who pride themselves on their strong values and traditions. Where some see disaster, they see opportunity!

- Claim or produce new luxury resources including Salt (NaCl), Machinery and Electronics

- New faction-specific art for Corporate and Gang factions

- Various balance fixes and adjustments to promotion and policy trees


Thanks for trying DeCiv. The game has been rebalanced; food and resources are scarce. Barbarians are more dangerous than you might expect.
